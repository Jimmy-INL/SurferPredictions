# Pipe Master Predictions

I used Machine Learning to make a model using pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and numpy to predict the results of Pipe Masters.

Every dataset in this repository was gathered and calculated manually so it may not be the most complete or accurate.
It seems to have heavy bias towards the rankings dataset so if you want to test this on your own make sure it is up to date.
